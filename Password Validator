// Isaak Treat
// Programming Challenge 36: Password Validator
/* You are developing a software package that requires users to enter their own passwords.
*  Your software requires that users' passwords meet the following criteria:
*  The password should be at least eight characters long.
*  The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
*  The password should have at least one digit.
*  The password should have at least one special character: ~`!@#$%^&*()-_=+{}|\;:"<>,./?
*  Write a program that asks for a password and then varifies that it meets the stated criteria.
*  If it doesn't, the program should display a message telling the user why.
