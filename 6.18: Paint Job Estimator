//Chapter 6, Programming Challenge 18: Paint job Estimator
/* A painting company has determined that for every 110 square feet of wall space,
* 1 gallon of paint and 8 hours of labor will be required. The company charges $25.00
* per hour of labor. Write a modular program that allows the user to enter the number
* of rooms that are to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. It should also
* ask for square feet of wall space in the rooms. It should then display the following data:
* The number of gallons of paint required
* The hours of labor required
* The cost of the paint
* The labor charges
* The total cost of the paint job
* Input validation: Do not accept a value less than 1 for the number of rooms. Do not accept
* a value less than $10.00 for the price of the paint. Do not accept a negative value for square
* footage of wall space.
