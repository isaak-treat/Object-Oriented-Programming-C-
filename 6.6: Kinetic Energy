//Chapter 6, Programming Challenge 6: Kinetic Energy
/* In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy.
* Write a function named kineticEnergy that accepts an object's mass (in kilograms)
* and velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. The function should return the amount
* of kinetic energy that the ojbect has. Demonstrate the function by calling it in a program
* that asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.
*/

double kineticEnergy(double mass, double velocity) {
	
	double totalKinetic;
	totalKinetic = ((mass * pow(velocity, 2)) / 2);
