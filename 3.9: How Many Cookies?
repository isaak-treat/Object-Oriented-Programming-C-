//Chapter 3, Programming Challenge 9: How Many Cookies?
/* A bag of cookies holds 30 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims there are
* 10 "servings" in the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program that
* asks the user to input how many cookies he or she actually ate, then reports how
* many total calories were consumed.
