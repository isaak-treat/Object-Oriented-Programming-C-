// Chapter 3, Programming Challenge 17: Math Tutor
/* Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student.
* The program should display two random numbers to be added.
* The program should then pause while the student works on the problem. When
* the student is ready to check the answer, he or she can press a key and
* the program will display the correct solution.
