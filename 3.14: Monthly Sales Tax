//Chapter 3, Programming Challenge 14: Monthly Sales Tax
/* A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales
* for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register
* (i.e. sales plus sales tax). Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent, and
* the county sales tax is 2 percent.
